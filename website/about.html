<p>Saylani Welfare International Trust is one of the largest charitable organizations in Pakistan, dedicated to humanitarian services and social welfare. Established in 1999 by Maulana Bashir Farooq Qadri, Saylani has grown from a small charity providing free meals to a massive organization offering food, healthcare, education, IT training, financial assistance, and disaster relief.

    With a mission to serve humanity, Saylani Welfare focuses on helping the underprivileged, alleviating poverty, and empowering communities by providing sustainable solutions. The organization is committed to uplifting the poor, ensuring that no one sleeps hungry, remains uneducated, or is deprived of medical treatment due to financial constraints.
    
    Saylani operates extensively in Pakistan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and the Middle East, making it a globally recognized NGO. Its remarkable initiatives have touched the lives of millions of people, providing food to the needy, scholarships to students, employment training to job seekers, and medical support to the sick.
    
    Saylani’s dedication to welfare is evident in its large-scale free food distribution programs, which serve over 100,000 meals daily across Pakistan. Additionally, their Saylani Mass IT Training Program (SMITP) has trained thousands of young individuals in Web Development, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain—helping them secure high-paying jobs both locally and internationally.
    
    Apart from food and education, Saylani has established hospitals, dialysis centers, water filtration plants, and emergency relief projects. Their financial support programs help families, widows, and orphans with monthly aid, ensuring that basic needs are met.
    
    With a firm belief in charity, service, and empowerment, Saylani Welfare International Trust continues to grow as a beacon of hope, transforming the lives of those in need through its compassionate and selfless efforts.</p>
